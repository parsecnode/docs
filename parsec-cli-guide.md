# Reference Client overview

## General overview

Parsec works through 2 separate binary files operated through command line:

1. **parsecd** – daemon to synchronize the blockchain and mine PARS (parsec).
2. **simplewallet** – wallet to receive and send funds.

Make sure to place these files in one separate folder. 


## Install Parsec

1. Unzip the archive to one separate folder. Parsec will generate 
additional data files and log files in the same directory.
The blockchain data is stored in `~/.parsec` on Linux/Unix systems, 
`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\parsec` on Windows or in
`~/Library/Application support/` on Mac OS.

## Launch Parsec

1. Open **parsecd**

2. Wait until **parsecd** is synchronized. This may take a while. You will be 
notified with several green "SYNCHRONIZED OK" messages.

3. Open **simplewallet**.


## Daemon: synchronization and mining

After **parsecd** is launched you will have to wait until it is synchronized with 
the network. You will be notified with several green "SYNCHRONIZED OK" messages. 
Here are the most important daemon commands:
* `start_mining <SECRET_SPEND_KEY> <SECRET_VIEW_KEY> [threads=1]` Start mining in several threads to a given wallet
* `stop_mining`					Stop mining
* `show_hr`						Show current mining hashrate
* `hide_hr`						Stop showing current mining hashrate
* `help`						Show all daemon commands
* `exit`						Exit parsecd

Please refer to [Mining guide](mining.md) for more info.

## Wallet: send and receive payments

Simplewallet can only be used after the daemon is launched and synchronized. 
Simlewallet automatically synchronizes with parsecd. Here are the most 
important wallet commands:

* `address`						Show your wallet address
* `balance`						Show current wallet balance
* `transfer <mixin_count> <address> <amount>`	Send money to `<address>` with a mixing amount of `<mixin_count>`
* `start_mining <threads>`		Start mining in daemon with several threads to the current wallet address
* `stop_mining`					Stop mining in daemon
* `help`						Show all wallet commands
* `exit`						Exit simplewallet
